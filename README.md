# XduUtilities

**This repository has been archived.**

## What's this repository
This is a collection of utilities for XDU students.

Most of utilities are written in C# with .NET Framework  while some compatible with .NET Core. If you are looking for tools or scripts which can be used on Linux, please refer to [xidian-scripts](https://github.com/xdlinux/xidian-scripts "xidian-scripts") owned by xdlinux or [xidian-scripts](https://github.com/Robotxm/xidian-scripts "xidian-scripts") owned by me.

Note that not all of my utilities will be re-written in other languages in order to run on Linux. Similarly, I will not re-write all of utilities provided by xdlinux in C#.
